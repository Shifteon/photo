    "This question came up while I was on a trip to Tillamook. As I was walking around the town and taking photos, I found myself wondering what kind of photography I was doing. An argument could be made for travel photography, but the photographs don't seem like the typical travel photograph, and Tillamook isn't a typical travel destination. Perhaps that doesn't matter… I was traveling, and I was documenting some part of the lives of the people in Tillamook, so travel photography could be a good fit."

    "Most of these photos are of houses and other buildings. So, is it architectural photography? The subjects themselves are architectural, yet it feels like there is more to it than that. I feel like by taking a photo of these homes, I am capturing part of the personality of the people who live there. When these photos are viewed together, you start to see the overall personality of the neighborhood and the town. This is a sentiment one of my favorite photographers Teo Crawford has expressed in his videos. I mention this because I think his thoughts have strongly influenced my subjects in photography and the way I view these photos."

I've recently come across the term “generalist” photographer. The type of photographer who photographs anything as opposed to a “specialist” who focuses on a particular subject or style. I am very much a generalist photographer. And I am content with that.",

    "Tillamook is a very small town. It has a charming downtown with nice restaurants and shops, but while I did visit and explore there, I spent most of my time photographing in the neighborhoods and near the outskirts of the town. I came across these old rusty vehicles in front of someone's house. I wonder how they got the jeep up there... There was also this playhouse. I thought it was a barn at first, but it was actually 'The Barn' a community playhouse."

    "The so-called outskirts of town, at least that is what I have called it, leads to miles of green fields full of cows and crops. There are beautiful mountains in the far distance. The long road going through it all would make for a scenic drive. Unfortunately I didn't make the time to do that, but I would love to come back sometime. Anyway, here is a small gallery from the trip. Hopefully these photos give a glimpse of what Tillamook is like."

    "I recently took a trip to Ocean Shores with my wife as a 'babymoon'. If you haven't heard of a babymoon, it is similar to a honeymoon, but you take it before you have a baby to relax and be alone together one last time before welcoming the baby into the world. We already have a 16 month old and my wife is 32 weeks pregnant with baby #2, so this babymoon was desperately needed. We stayed in the small, but charming Canterbury Inn, which is conveniently placed near the beach. Unfortunately, the trail to the beach didn't seem too welcoming..."

    "This dark little trail I couldn't stand up in was the last place I wanted to meet a bear! We decided to continue anyway, and although we didn't see any bears, we did get eaten up by mosquitos. Luckily the trail opened up before too long, and awarded us with great views. Random side note, some of these photos may seem not as good in terms of exposure and image quality, and that's because I found a nice little digicam at a thrift shop at the beginning of the trip. Overall I am very happy with the photos it produces and I love using it, but this photo of the trail didn't turn out the best."

Considering this, these beaches weren't the kind where people lay out and sun tan, surf, or jump in the waves. Instead, people walked their dogs, flew kites, and watched the birds. Crazy people like me took photos in the some of the flattest light possible. I still love all these photos and I think some of them turned out fantastic, but a little light would not have hurt them."

I think this only works because there is a lot of space around the middle bird, so it feels like it is separate from all the other birds. I just love the bird's pose. At first I thought it was drinking, but I now realize that that doesn't make much sense... Maybe it is eating."

Ocean Shores is a fun place and there's still a lot we haven't explored, places such as Damon Point come to mind, so we'll have to come again sometime."
